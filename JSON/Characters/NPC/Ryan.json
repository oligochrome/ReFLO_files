He hates troublesome things and often played hooky as a student.\n\nHe and the Ice Wolf Magician Cliff were both peers and rivals as students. He often quarreled with the hardworking Cliff.\n\nBecause he is a genius, he grew up having never encountered a setback or roadblock once and feels that his life is \"Easy Mode\" in which he can muddle along day in and day out. However, he is actually tired of this kind of life, and deep down, he looks forward to finding something to get serious about.\n\nHe treats girls—even female cats—quite gently, but as for guys, he just deals with them casually.
