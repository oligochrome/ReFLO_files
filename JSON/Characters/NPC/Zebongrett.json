Having grown up alongside Castele's Princess Laura Stone, now that he is older, he is tasked with taking care of the princess.\n\nAlthough he speaks rudely and doesn't know how to be likable, he has a strong sense of justice and is always thinking of his allies, so people who know him trust him. He is the only person who calls Laura \"M'Lady.\" He worries about Laura's overly lively character, and even now, when they are separated, he continues to pay attention to her whereabouts.\n\nUnder the direct orders of King Erik of Castele, he is traveling the world to investigate the \"abnormities brought about by the forces of darkness.\" Whenever he arrives at a new place for investigation, he solves the local monster problem simply and neatly and then turns around and leaves without a word. Because of this, at some point, people started calling him the \"Swift Meteor.\"\n\nHe likes animals and children very much, but because of his scary demeanor, they're often not willing to get near him, which causes him some distress. He feels a bit of sympathy for Glenn the Dragonslayer, who also has an unlikable personality. As for fellow Plushling Mercenary Miguel, he greatly admires his strength.",
