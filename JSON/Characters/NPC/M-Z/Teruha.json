Her apprentices include Viola and Bezel.\n\nBecause of her gentle nature, politeness and beautiful features, as well as her graceful posture while fishing, she has attracted many fans. The current Master Angler, Fisherman Sage, who once served as her master, is also her fan. He often comes up with various excuses to invite her on dates. However, Teruha can always perfectly dodge him.\n\nShe doesn't just like fishing; she also likes watching fish. Legend has it that once a monster went crazy and scared the fish away, and she used her super-fierce glare\nto calm the beast down. She is also a seasoned cat person who brings the fish she's caught to Black Cat Jinx the Master Magician and other cats.\n\nThe Woodcutter Tsukiha is her twin sister. It's said that Their mother was an Angler and their father a Woodcutter. Teruha used to be taken to the river by her mother, while Tsukiha was taken to the forest by her father. After going so frequently, naturally they embarked on these paths, going further and further.",
