Her apprentices include Art and Litona.\n\nShe looks calm and intellectual, but even the slightest thing can send her into a panic. If you're not feeling well, she won't hesitate to douse you in potion. She is always worried about Litona, who enjoys performing risky experiments.\n\nShe actually has two personalities—\"calm, cautious, and steady Sophie,\" and \"bold, confident Sophie.\" Of these two personalities, the one that usually emerges is the calm Sophie, but during experiments, or on nights when the moon's power is particularly strong, the bold Sophie will rush out. The calm Sophie is not very good at coexisting peacefully with the bold Sophie. In the past, this has caused some experiments to fail. Since then, their relationship has worsened. The Magician Sloane knows about the two Sophies' existence, and is also the person who understands her best. \n\nShe cares little for romance, and although fellow Alchemist Demiel instilled many romance-related guidelines, they essentially went in one ear and out the other, heard but not understood.",
