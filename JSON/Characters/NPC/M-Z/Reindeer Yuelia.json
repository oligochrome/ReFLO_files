    "EpisodeText": "A mysterious girl you encountered at the Origin Island of Namona. She is the twin sister of Noelia the Lunare secretary.\n\nShe is cheerful, optimistic, and gentle. Perhaps because she's so eager to help others, she likes to get herself involved in everything. Also, she lacks understanding regarding the ways of the world, and often blurts things out crudely, which often hurts others.\n\nUnlike her twin sister Noelia, she cannot use Lunare powers, so she has decided to stay in the mortal realm and assist the God's Envoy. She can always be seen by the God's Envoy's side ever since.",
