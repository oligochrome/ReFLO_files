    "EpisodeText": "A cheerful and lively Tailor now living in Al Maajik. She enjoys making cute clothes and accessories.\n\nShe was born in a family with generations of skilled Blacksmiths, and she once practiced as a Blacksmith. However, after her brother Crawford changed careers and became a Miner, she too became determined to do what she really likes and embarked on a journey to become a Tailor. The flower accessory she always wears was given to her by Crawford on the day she made up her mind to reinvent herself. Although she sometimes feels annoyed with her brother, who is always watching over her and lecturing her at the drop of a hat, she still relies on him from time to time.\n\nPerhaps because she grew up surrounded by men, she is a bit of a tomboy, so when she became a Tailor, she sought Demiel's guidance in making herself cuter. However, her old habit of wording like a boy will still occasionally slip out.\n\nShe regards Nafel, the granddaughter of the notorious Alchemist Prof. Snooze as her bestie and deeply admires how she could forge her own path.",
