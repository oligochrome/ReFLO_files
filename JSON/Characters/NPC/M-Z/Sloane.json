Her students include Lily and Vidal.\n\nHe is an expert in healing and Earth magics, but he is often found spacing out and reprimanded by students for dozing off when he should be working. The truth is, this is because he spends all night monitoring spirits, emotions, and the balance of the world, making it difficult for him to stay awake during daytime.\n\nHe likes stars and flowers. Although he is usually gentle and steady, if he meets people who make light of nature or destroy it, his fury erupts like a volcano. Although he is qualified for a Master in every way, he despises troublesome things and has been cleverly shirking the recommendations of the current Master, Magician Jinx.\n\nHe often speaks and acts without thinking, but in actuality, he is a sharp and alert person with a perceptive mind (which is often shut down).\n\nHe looks youthful, but is actually quite old and often makes far-sighted remarks.",
