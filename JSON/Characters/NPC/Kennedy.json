Because she is the Carpenter of the War Carpenter family, she has been called the \"Carpenter of the Battlefield.\" Her apprentices include Kanna and Yasli.\n\nShe is very competitive and seldom backs down. She is a childhood friend of Master Carpenter Woody. Although she trusts Woody's abilities as a Carpenter, she finds his indecisive personality to be unbearable and often can't help but scream at him or persuade him violently. She is quite masculine in her behavior, but also very good at taking care of others and has a sentimental side. As the daughter of a legendary War Carpenter, she has had the expectations of many people around her thrust upon her, so she sometimes suffers from stress.\n\nThe Woodcutter Belhart is her father's partner, and his daughter Mayna is her friend. Although the commissions Mayna requests for her squirrel friend can be quite unreasonable, such as \"a cute little axe for cracking open nuts,\" can make her feel bewildered, she still meticulously completes each of her requests.\n\nBecause she worries about the Woodcutter Woolf, her good friend living all alone on the Mt Snowpeak Summit, she sometimes makes the trek to the top of Mt Snowpeak alone.",
