    "EpisodeText": "A free and easygoing Hunter who was born with the wind. He is rather stuck in his ways, and his words and actions are also quite frivolous. At a first glance, he doesn't seem to have any ideas of his own. However, he treats protecting the forest as his mission and patrols it every day.\n\nHe is also well-informed and knowledgeable when it comes to nature and beasts. He has a strength not inferior to Life Masters and an exceptional sensitivity, but often uses roundabout expressions difficult for ordinary folk to understand. Even a good friend of many years may be completely unable to understand what he's talking about. Additionally, he may spend countless hours practicing drawing his bow researching for handsome archery postures.\n\nHe and Master Hunter Fern are apprentices of the same master. Despite the exasperation she feels toward his frivolous character and abnormal words and actions, the two acknowledge each other's strength and trust one another.\n\nWhen he'd just become an adept Hunter, on his way home from a mission he encountered the homeless siblings Lusica and Jerry, who he took home with him and accepted as his apprentices.
