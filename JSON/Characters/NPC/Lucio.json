The worse the situation, the stronger she will become. Although she has a big personality, she cares for her juniors like a big sister. Especially when she sees cute, frustrated kids, she cannot sit back and ignore them. She dotes on her apprentice Raim very much.\n\nAs a child, she was timid and cowardly. She became a Mercenary in order to change that part of herself. However, being a \"Mercenary\" often requires facing powerful foes alone. This scared her and made she regret her choiceâ€”that was until a certain battle, which led her to realize that being a Mercenary was more of a \"battle against oneself.\" From then on, she began to desperately take on various missions in order to not lose to herself. Later one, she got the alias of \"Redhead Lucio.\"",
