His strict family education has granted him a serious and selflessness character and a strong sense of justice.\n\nHe is strong, but humble and polite. He never looks down on or talks bad about others. Therefore, he is highly respected by younger generations, and the new recruit Karl is his number one fan. His handsome looks have also caused him to be quite popular, so much so that he could form his own fan club. But he himself is quite slow when it comes to such matters and has no awareness of his popularity at all. He is the exact opposite of the Shield of Castele, Porthos, in both personality and constitution, but they share a tacit friendship.\n\nHis fellow Paladins also include his little sister Hilda and his childhood friend and sister's close friend Frey. In their youth, he often took on the role of an elder brother and played with the two of them. Not surprisingly, they've trained their swordsmanship with him.\n\nHe likes sweets, particularly pudding. The pudding he enjoys after completing a day's work serves as one of his life's little pleasures. Whenever the castle's head chef Josette tasks him with tasting her new pudding recipe, his smile shines a little bit brighter for the rest of the day.",
