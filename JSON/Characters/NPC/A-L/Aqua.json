Her smile has attracted numerous people to join the guard. However, if she finds people polluting the sea, she will mercilessly \"teach them some manners\"while still smiling. Many people have also been frightened by her two sides. She excels at balancing kindness and sternness, and is highly respected by her subordinates. \n\nShe also has a high tolerance for alcohol, and even when drinking with pirates, she'll always drink them under the table.\n\nThe leader of the Port Puerto Guard, Olivia, is her boss and childhood playmate. When they've just known each other, the two of them had very little to talk about in private. That was until unknown persons polluted Kiraby Coast, and the two accidentally worked together to pursue the culprits. As a result, they found the real culprits before the grown-ups, and the two of them acknowledged each other and became good friends. Nowadays, the two guard the waters of Port Puerto together.\n\nRuby, an undercover cadet of Castele, is her cousin.",
