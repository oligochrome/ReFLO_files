    "EpisodeText": "A Mercenary who uses exotic swordsmanship like the wind. He is optimistic, occasionally going too far, but his attainments in swordsmanship are indeed obvious to all. His unique swordsmanship was learned from his adoptive father and master.\n\nHis master, being a head monk, also taught him cultural lessons, but he obviously has no talent in this area. Moreover, he hates staying still and wants to slip out as soon as he finds an opportunity, and the punishment for that—meditating—makes him suffer even more.\n\nHe likes his master and respects him very much, but he wonders why he, a monk, has more troubles than non-religious people. Regarding the sudden act of being driven out of the temple by his master to train, he feels a little dissatisfied, but he still aims to surpass his master and travels all across Reveria to grow stronger.\n\nHis hobby when traveling and studying is to buy local specialty snacks, eating and shopping. It is said that he has written hundreds of records on various foods. Just like the Paladin Porthos and the Cook Glutton, he is a fellow member of the \"Gourmet Club.\"",
