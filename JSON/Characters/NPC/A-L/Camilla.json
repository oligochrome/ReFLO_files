    "EpisodeText": "A vampire from the Devildom. Although he is a vampire, he doesn't like to drink blood and instead prefers tomato juice.\n\nHe has a dark and negative personality, and his speech is unclear and quiet. As a result, he's often asked to repeat himself. Then he becomes even more nervous and stammers even more. Nevertheless, he still likes talking to people and is afraid of loneliness, so people will often turn their head to find him standing behind and joining the conversation. Although he hopes to be good friends with everyone, the more attention he gets, the more his innately negative mentality and unclear voice become insurmountable, resulting in his failure to carry things out smoothly.\n\nBecause he is a demon, his body is filled with magical power. He is bad at getting up early, and his meeting Princess Liz of Al Maajik was also because he fainted on the side of the road due to lack of sleep.\n\nHe greatly admires the Dark Sultan Daemon and hopes that he can one day be as majestic and calm as him. Even though he is younger than himself, he still respects him very much.\n\nThe stake in his heart is a punishment from the past as well as a seal to prevent his power from running rampant.",
