She is a childhood friend of fellow Paladins Jake and Hilda, and she shares a lifelong friendship with Hilda.\n\nUnlike the weak and low-key Hilda, she is competitive and makes a clear distinction between her likes and dislikes. She always speaks straight and to the point. At the same time, she is quite thoughtful toward her friends. She always supports and encourages Hilda, who feels down because she considers herself not fit to be a Paladin. She thinks of herself as Hilda's reliable big sister, but actually, Hilda has helped her many times with her not noticing.\n\nWhen they were little, Jake would often play with her and Hilda, and because of this, she sees Jake as her big brother. After seeing Jake become a Paladin and devote himself to his missions, she decided to become a Paladin as well and asked Jake to teach her and Hilda swordsmanship. However, out of consideration for their ages and statuses as senior and junior, along with her own shyness, she no longer called Jake \"bro,\" instead using honorifics.\n\nIn order to get Jake's recognition and make him no longer regard her as a child, she diligently practices every day.",
