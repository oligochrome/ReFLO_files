Her apprentice is a young girl called Glutton.\n\nShe has an extraordinary sense of taste known as the \"Goddess's Tongue.\" It's said that any dish approved by her will surely be approved by the entire world. The dishes she makes are so delicious, they can make people lose themselves and obey her every word. Cooks hoping for her critique are always seeking her out in droves, so she's always very busy. She always says, \"Deliciousness is justice.\"\n\nRecently, she has given full control of the main courses to her sous-chef Allan, while she concentrates on making desserts. In order to make impressively delicious dishes, she writes down all kinds of new ideas every day, working even late into the night.\nShe is a real go-getter.\n\nHer love of desserts comes from her mother, who served as the previous Head Chef. Whenever she quarrels with others or feels down and needs to cheer up, her mother always makes desserts for her. Because of this, she has already made up her mind to make dishes that can bring smiles to people's faces.",
