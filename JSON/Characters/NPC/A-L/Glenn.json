From then on, he began to consider his reason for wielding his sword and the real meaning of the word \"strength.\"\nLater, a red-headed female Mercenary introduced him to the Crowned Champion, from whom he learned the swordsmanship of Mercenaries, and he embarked on the road of a Mercenary. Since then, although he would never actually admit it, he has always regarded the Crowned Champion as his master.\n\nLike a puritan, he is extremely strict with both himself and others, and his fierce eyes often draw criticism. Faced with such accusations, his answer is always, \"That's just how my eyes are naturally.\"\n\nIt is said that he can slay dragons due to an adventure during his youth, but nobody knows the truth. His private life is a mystery,\n\nbut it's said that people often see him wandering on the west Grassy Plains.",
