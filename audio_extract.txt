__**Audio Extraction Process**__
- The criware audio files (ACB/AWB) are found in the ``OBB_EXTRACT/assets`` 
--  CueSheetBGM_INIT.acb  = Contains the title song for FL and FFXIV
--  CueSheetSE_INIT.acb = Contains the sound effect files

- Use VGMToolbox to extract ACB -> HCA by doing:  VGMToolbox > Misc. Tools > Common Archives > CRI ACB/AWB Archive > Drag & drop the ACB files

- Go in to the extracted HCA folder (_vgmt.../awb/) and extract the HCA with vgmstream's test.exe
-- For an easy time, just make a BAT file with the following command then drag & drop the HCA on to the bat file:
```cmd
VGMSTREAM_PATH/test.exe -o ?f.wav %1
```
vgmstream wildcards: ?s=subsong, ?n=stream name, ?f=infile name
%1 = first file argument = the path of the file if you drag and drop

If you have oggenc installed for direct compression, you can use the -x command instead. See -h for more info

- This will result in you getting the large WAV file. From there, use a converter to get a compressed audio file.

||For future reference but not needed here: the key could be found in the __raw__ extracted ``MonoBehaviour/CriWareInitializer.dat`` and viewed with a hex viewer. FLO's key was 123456789 but, as I mentioned, we will not be used this here.
